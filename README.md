Fill the obtained database with random data (~30-50 students, 3 groups, 5-8 subjects, 3-5 teachers, up to 20 grades for each student for all subjects). Use the Faker package to populate the data.

Perform the following queries from the obtained database:

Find the 5 students with the highest average grade for all subjects.
Find the student with the highest average grade for a specific subject.
Find the average grade for each group for a specific subject.
Find the overall average grade for all subjects.
Find the courses taught by a specific teacher.
Find the list of students in a specific group.
Find the grades of students in a specific group for a specific subject.
Find the average grade given by a specific teacher for their subjects.
Find the list of courses that a specific student is taking.
Find the list of courses that a specific teacher is teaching to a specific student.
For each query, create a separate file named "query_number.sql", where "number" is replaced by the query number. The file should contain the SQL statement that can be executed in the database terminal or using cursor.execute(sql).
